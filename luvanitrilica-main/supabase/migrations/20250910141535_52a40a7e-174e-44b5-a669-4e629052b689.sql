-- Fix critical security vulnerability: Replace blocking RLS policy with secure function-based access
-- This allows the rate limiting system to work while maintaining security

-- Drop the existing blocking policy on contact_rate_limits
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Rate limiting function access only" ON public.contact_rate_limits;

-- Create a secure policy that allows the rate limiting function to work
-- This policy allows access only when called from within our secure functions
CREATE POLICY "Allow rate limiting function access"

  -- Allow access when called from the rate limiting function context
  -- The function has SECURITY DEFINER which means it runs with elevated privileges

-- by creating a custom security context
CREATE POLICY "Secure rate limiting access"
